## 1. Abstract
The **Gross Human Dynamics Product (GHDP)** is a macro-structural framework designed to measure the friction between systemic acceleration and human adaptive capacity. Unlike traditional economic metrics that prioritize velocity and output, GHDP quantifies the "temporal drag" that emerges when decision cycles outpace human cognitive throughput.

## 2. Core Methodology
The framework posits that instability in modern macro-systems is not primarily analytical but **temporal**. We observe this through the lens of specific variables:

* **Velocity ($V_s$):** The rate of information update and systemic execution.
* **Capacity ($H_c$):** The physiological and psychological limit of human processing.
* **Friction ($F_t$):** The emergent resistance when $V_s > H_c$.

## 3. Mathematical Definition
The core friction coefficient is modeled as a divergence function:

$$
F_t = \frac{\Delta V_{systemic}}{\Delta H_{adaptive}} \times \alpha
$$

Where:
* $F_t$ represents the Friction Index (0 to 1).
* $\Delta V$ is the rate of change in systemic complexity.
* $\alpha$ is the volatility multiplier (Perception Risk).

> *Note: Full derivation and variable definitions are available in the internal technical paper.*

## 4. Key Axioms
1.  **The Acceleration Gap:** Systems scale exponentially; human cognition scales linearly.
2.  **Signal Decay:** As velocity increases, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases inversely.
3.  **Latent Risk:** Friction accumulates silently as "efficiency" until it manifests as sudden structural failure.

# Part II: The Logic — Tempo Economics

## 1. GHDP: A New Civilizational Metric
Gross Healthy Dynamics Product (GHDP) is the first metric to quantify "Human Time Health."

$$GHDP = TSI \times CBR \times PRA \times RDV$$

## 2. Four Core Indicators
* **TSI (Time Sovereignty Index):** Ratio of meaningful vs. coerced time.
* **CBR (Cognitive Bandwidth Ratio):** Mental capacity free from fragmentation.
* **PRA (Physiological Rhythm Alignment):** Sleep and biological recovery metrics.
* **RDV (Relational Depth Value):** Time allocated to family and community connection.

## 3. Cognitive Debt & Innovation Yield
* **Cognitive Debt:** The accumulated cost of fragmented attention. High debt = Low innovation.
* **The ROI of Rest:** "Slow Intelligence" is the foundation of deep strategy. We calculate the economic return on recovery time.

# Chapter 7: The Four Core Indicators
**Technical Definitions & Measurement Architecture**

To govern civilization, we must measure what matters.
GHDP is calculated through four composite indicators, each representing a critical dimension of human capacity.

## 1. TSI — Time Sovereignty Index (The Baseline)
> **Definition:** The ratio of time a citizen fully controls versus time coerced by external systemic demands.

* **The Formula:**
  $$TSI = \frac{T_{autonomous}}{T_{total} - T_{biological}}$$
    * $T_{autonomous}$: Time free from work, algorithmic interruptions, and forced administration.
    * $T_{biological}$: Minimum time required for sleep (7.5h) and hygiene.

* **Why it matters:**
  When TSI drops below **0.30** (30% autonomy), social friction spikes. Citizens feel "trapped," leading to political volatility and migration of high-value talent.

## 2. CBR — Cognitive Bandwidth Ratio (The Capacity)
> **Definition:** The measure of a nation's collective ability to perform Deep Work versus Shallow Work.

* **The Formula:**
  $$CBR = \frac{Focus_{depth}}{Interruption_{frequency}}$$
    * **Metric:** Average duration of uninterrupted work sessions before an algorithmic or bureaucratic interruption occurs.

* **The Crisis:**
  In 2015, the average CBR was **15 mins**. In 2025, it is **45 seconds**.
  A low CBR nation produces "Activity," but zero "Insight." It is the primary cause of the **Innovation Stagnation**.

## 3. PRA — Physiological Rhythm Alignment (The Battery)
> **Definition:** The synchronization between a citizen's biological circadian rhythm and their economic schedule.

* **Key Metrics:**
    1.  **Sleep Consistency Score:** Not just hours, but regularity.
    2.  **National HRV (Heart Rate Variability):** An aggregated proxy for collective stress resilience.
    3.  **The "Social Jetlag" Index:** The gap between natural waking time and economic alarm time.

* **Why it matters:**
  PRA is the leading indicator for healthcare costs. A 10% drop in PRA correlates with a 15% rise in chronic disease expenditure within 5 years.

## 4. RDV — Relational Depth Value (The Glue)
> **Definition:** The density and quality of social connections that provide emotional buffering.

* **Measurement:**
    * **Family Proximity Time:** Hours spent in physical proximity with immediate family without screen interference.
    * **Weak Tie Diversity:** The health of community interactions (neighbors, civic groups).

* **The Collapse:**
  In high-speed economies, RDV collapses first. This leads to the **"Lonely Crowd"** phenomenon, where GDP is high, but the suicide rate and depression rate soar.

### Summary Table: The GHDP Scorecard

| Indicator | Good State (>0.7) | Warning State (0.4-0.6) | Critical State (<0.4) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TSI** | "I own my day." | "I am chasing time." | "I am a slave to the system." |
| **CBR** | Deep Innovation | Administrative Fatigue | Cognitive Fragmentation |
| **PRA** | High Energy | Chronic Tiredness | Biological Burnout |
| **RDV** | Strong Community | Social Isolation | Atomized Society |

**Policy Implication:**
Singapore's current priority is to raise **CBR** (Innovation) and **PRA** (Health).
GDP growth achieved by sacrificing PRA is **"False Growth"**—it is simply borrowing from the Ministry of Health's future budget.

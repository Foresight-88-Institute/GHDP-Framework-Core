# Part II: The Logic — Tempo Economics

## 1. GHDP: A New Civilizational Metric
Gross Healthy Dynamics Product (GHDP) is the first metric to quantify "Human Time Health."

$$GHDP = TSI \times CBR \times PRA \times RDV$$

## 2. Four Core Indicators
* **TSI (Time Sovereignty Index):** Ratio of meaningful vs. coerced time.
* **CBR (Cognitive Bandwidth Ratio):** Mental capacity free from fragmentation.
* **PRA (Physiological Rhythm Alignment):** Sleep and biological recovery metrics.
* **RDV (Relational Depth Value):** Time allocated to family and community connection.

## 3. Cognitive Debt & Innovation Yield
* **Cognitive Debt:** The accumulated cost of fragmented attention. High debt = Low innovation.
* **The ROI of Rest:** "Slow Intelligence" is the foundation of deep strategy. We calculate the economic return on recovery time.

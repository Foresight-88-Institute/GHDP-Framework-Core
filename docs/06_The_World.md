* **Japan:** Partner on **Society 5.0** to solve demographic aging via rhythm optimization.
* **Global Tempo Compact:** A UN-level agreement on protecting human time sovereignty.

## 3. The Tempo Civilization Network (TCN)
A coalition of "Temporal Leader" nations (e.g., Singapore, Finland, Japan) adopting GHDP.

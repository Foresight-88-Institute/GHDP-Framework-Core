# Part V: Evidence & Resilience — Stress Testing the System

## 1. The Singapore Simulation (Case Study 0.287)
* **The Shock Point:** Our model identifies a critical threshold (0.287) where efficiency turns into fragility.
* **Result:** Below this point, additional GDP growth yields negative GHDP returns.

## 2. Stress Tests
We simulate civilizational resilience under three scenarios:
1.  **Black Mirror:** Total algorithmic capture of attention.
2.  **AI Bubble:** Rapid acceleration of labor demands.
3.  **Climate Shock:** Resource scarcity combined with tempo collapse.

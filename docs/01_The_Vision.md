# Part I: The Vision — A Crisis of Rhythm

## 1. Executive Summary: The Tempo Problem
**One Sentence Interpretation:** We thought we were growing, but we are actually overdrafting the battery of civilization.

We are facing a structural paradox:
* **GDP is rising** (Economic Velocity $\uparrow$)
* **GHDP is falling** (Civilizational Battery $\downarrow$)

This is the **"Great Divergence."**

## 2. The Great Divergence (GDP vs. GHDP)

* **Economic Output (GDP):** Measures the speed of extraction.
* **Human Capacity (GHDP):** Measures the sustainability of the workforce.
* **The Gap:** The widening distance between these two curves is "Tempo Debt."

## 3. The National Tempo Map
We propose a visual dashboard for national leadership.
* **Red Zone:** High Anxiety / Sleep Deprivation / High GDP (Risk of Collapse).
* **Green Zone:** High GHDP / Sustainable Rhythm / High Innovation.

## 4. Why Time Sovereignty Now?
In the AI age, the ultimate scarcity is not information, but **Cognitive Sovereignty**. A nation that cannot protect its people's rhythm will lose its ability to innovate.
